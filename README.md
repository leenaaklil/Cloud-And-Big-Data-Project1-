# NYC Taxi Data ETL Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** for NYC taxi trip data using **Python, Airflow, MinIO, and PostgreSQL**.  
The pipeline automates the ingestion of large taxi datasets, stores the raw data, processes and cleans it, and finally uses it for querying and analysis.

---

## Project Objectives
- Automate the extraction of NYC taxi trip data.
- Clean and transform raw CSV data for analysis.
- Store processed data in a relational database for efficient querying.
- Demonstrate integration of **Docker, Airflow, MinIO, and PostgreSQL** in a real-world ETL workflow.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language for ETL tasks.
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestration of ETL workflow.
- **MinIO**: Object storage for raw datasets.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for processed data.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization of the entire stack.
